When creating a hero-image using HTML and CSS, it is easy for anyone to just copy and paste the code from another source. However, in order to fully understand the code and use it later on in other projects without constantly referring to the same website, it is crucial to understand every bit of code.

<h3>Creating a Hero Image : CSS</h3>

Code:https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp

Now let's figure out what each line means: (the ones that are not so easy to understand (basics will not be included here))

<b>background-position:</b> The background-position property in CSS means the position of the background image. In this case, the background image will be in the center.
<br><br>
<b>background-repeat:</b> This means that the background-image can repeat along the verical or horizantal axis; or it cannot repeat at all. In this case, the background-image will not repeat at all.
<br><br>
<b>background-size: cover -></b> This is referring to the size of the background image. 'Cover' is used to make the background-image as big as possible such that it will fill the entire background area with leaving any gaps.
<br><br>
<b>position: relative</b> -> This places an image relative ot its origanal position without changing the layout around it(refernece: https://leannezhang.medium.com/difference-between-css-position-absolute-versus-relative-35f064384c6)
<br><br>
<b> hero-text:</b> This is referring to the text of the hero-image.
<br><br>
<b>position: absolute -></b> This "places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it" (reference: https://leannezhang.medium.com/difference-between-css-position-absolute-versus-relative-35f064384c6).
<br><br>
  <b>transform:translate -></b> "The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model" (reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform). 
  <br><br>
  "The translate() CSS function repositions an element in the horizontal and/or vertical directions. Its result is a <transform-function> data type. This transformation is characterized by a two-dimensional vector. Its coordinates define how much the element moves in each direction." (reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate())
